# Parking Lot Detection with RFDETR
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for detecting parking lots using the [RFDETR](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/rfdetr) object detection model, trained on a custom dataset exported from Roboflow in COCO format. It includes distributed training support via PyTorch's `torchrun`, prediction visualization, and usage examples.
